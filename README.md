Note: we changed the torch button to a switch because it is more user friendly.

--How could you use the above code to identify heart rate?

We could see how the average colors fluctuate over time. We can tell when the heart is pumping blood because your finger will most likely be more red than when the heart is not pumping.

--Could you write code that turns on the torch whenever someone places their finger over the camera?

Yes. When a finger is detected, we can check if the torch is on. If it's not, call the setTorchOn function, and set the value of torchIsOn to YES.

--Each float array created was 100 points long: how many seconds of data is this?

It took an average of 3.3 seconds to fill up all three arrays, over 10 tries.
